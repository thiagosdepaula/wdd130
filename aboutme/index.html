    <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! I am Thiago de Paula. I am from Brazil, but I am currently living in the state of Washington with my wife and our sweet daughter. We love to spend our time outside exploring the nature and the world.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is to play soccer and pickeball. I have been playing soccer since I was a little kid, and  in the last few years I discovered pickleball which is a not common game in Brazil.</p>
    <p>I am really excited for this semester. It is my very first time learning something in the technology area. I know it will be very challanging for me, but will be worth it.</p>
    <p>I am looking foward to building websites and apps by myself in the future. It is one of my life goals.</p>
    <p>I wish everyone good luck this semester!</p>
