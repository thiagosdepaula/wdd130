            <p>First, you will fill out a quick contact form lets me know more about the session you are hoping for. Then I’ll send you my investment guide as well as a link for a consultation call. This call will be a no-pressure, casual conversation where I can explain my process to you. This will also be the opportunity to ask all of your questions to see if I am a good fit for you! If you decide that you would like to work with me, we’ll schedule a date for your session and sign your booking proposal.</p>

            <p>Once we make things official, we will prepare for your session will a stying appointment. I will help you choose clothing for your session that photographs beautifully and makes you feel like a million bucks. These clothing items may be picked from your own closet, purchased from your favorite brands, or borrowed from my client closet. We’ll also decide together the best location for your session to take place, whether that be my studio or an outdoor location. At the end of this appointment, we will take a look at your home and decide the best place to display your artwork.</p>
