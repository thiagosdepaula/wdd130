          <h2>When is the best time to book my maternity session?</h2>
          <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Dolore facilis omnis similique rem, aliquam quibusdam saepe tat!</p>
          <h2>When is the best time to book a newborn session?</h2>
          <p>I recommend you book your newborn session just after you reach 20 weeks of your pregnancy. You can schedule the session for when your baby is between 10 days and 3 weeks old if you want the sleepy baby photos. I wait until the first week after birth for you and baby to get adjusted to your new life together. Also, if you are breastfeeding, I like to give you time for your breastmilk to come in so baby can be sufficiently fed and consoled during the portrait session.</p>
          <p>If you can't schedule in the first three weeks, don't worry because we can still get beautiful newborn images! The older your baby becomes, the more likely they will be awake during your session and not want to be put down. In these cases most of the photos will be of you holding your newborn which is totally fine too! Some families take newborn photos when their baby is 6,7, or even 8 weeks old. I promise that I will still be able to capture the beautiful connection between you and your baby no matter how old they are.</p>
