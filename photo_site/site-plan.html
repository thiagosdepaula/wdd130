      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <h4>Step One: Inquire</h4>
      <p>First, you will fill out a quick <strong>contact form </strong> lets me know more about the session you are hoping for. Then I’ll send you my investment guide as well as a link for a consultation call. This call will be a no-pressure, casual conversation where I can explain my process to you. This will also be the opportunity to ask all of your questions to see if I am a good fit for you! If you decide that you would like to work with me, we’ll schedule a date for your session and sign your booking proposal.</p>
      <h4>Step two: Prepare</h4>
      <p>Once we make things official, we will prepare for your session will a stying appointment. I will help you        choose clothing for your session that photographs beautifully and makes you feel like a million bucks.        These clothing items may be picked from your own closet, purchased from your favorite brands, or borrowed from my client closet. We’ll also decide together the best location for your session to take place, whether that be my studio or an outdoor location. At the end of this appointment, we will take a look at your home and decide the best place to display your artwork.</p>
      <h4>Step Three: Create</h4>
      <p>On the day of your session, my hair and make-up artist will meet you at my studio or at your house to make you feel beautiful and dolled-up. Then, we will continue to the portrait location where I will capture the sweet bond between you and your babies.</p>
      <h4>Step Four: Design and Order</h4>
      <p>Well meet once again to choose your favorite images from the session. I’ll create mockups of wall galleries and photo albums for you to envision in your home. From here, you’ll place your order and await your final delivery.</p>
      <h4>Step Five: Install and Enjoy</h4>
      <p>The artwork of your sweet family will be ready to be picked up approximately 8-12 weeks after your ordering appointment. I offer a complimentary installation for all of the framed prints in your gallery. After your prints are hung on your wall, you can enjoy them for years and remember how little your babies once were!</p>

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <h4>When is the best time to book my maternity session?</h4>
      <p>The best time to photograph your pregnancy is when you are between 28-34 weeks along. This will allow your belly enough time to be nice and round, but won’t be too late in your pregnancy when you are feeling uncomfortable.</p>
      <h4>When is the best time to book a newborn session?</h4>
      <p>I recommend you book your newborn session just after you reach 20 weeks of your pregnancy. You can schedule the session for when your baby is between 10 days and 3 weeks old if you want the sleepy baby photos. I wait until the first week after birth for you and baby to get adjusted to your new life together. Also, if you are breastfeeding, I like to give you time for your breastmilk to come in so baby can be sufficiently fed and consoled during the portrait session.</p>
      <p>If you can't schedule in the first three weeks, don't worry because we can still get beautiful newborn images! The older your baby becomes, the more likely they will be awake during your session and not want to be put down. In these cases most of the photos will be of you holding your newborn which is totally fine too! Some families take newborn photos when their baby is 6,7, or even 8 weeks old. I promise that I will still be able to capture the beautiful connection between you and your baby no matter how old they are.</p>
